# Translating templates

## Lexical Analysis (Scanning)

### Scanning modes

Serianilla scanner has 2 modes: `text_on` and `text_off`. These are used
to correctly interpret the XML-like template syntax. Between `<>` the
scanner operates in text mode being off, that is treating each word
or symbol as a token. In other cases the scanner treats anything as a text.

### Supported tokens

| Token            | Regex                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Opening tag start| `<`                                               |
| Opening tag end  | `/>`                                              |
| Closing tag start| `</`                                              |
| Tag end          | `>`                                               |
| Assign           | `=`                                               |
| Attach start     | `{`                                               |
| Attach end       | `}`                                               |
| Dot              | `.`                                               |
| String           | `"[^"\n]*"`                                       |
| Component        | `#[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*`                                 |
| Event            | `@[a-z][a-z]*`                                    |
| Keyword          | `$[a-z][a-z]*`                                    |
| Identifier       | `[a-zA-Z](-[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]*)*[a-zA-Z0-9]*` |
